**Title:** Virtual Screening of Natural Compounds for Potential Anti-COVID-19 Drug Candidates

**Impact:**
This project aims to identify novel compounds from a library of natural products that may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. By leveraging computational methods, we can accelerate the drug discovery process, potentially leading to the identification of safe and effective therapeutic agents with fewer side effects.

**Background:**
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective antiviral agents. Natural products have historically been a rich source for drug discovery due to their diverse scaffolds and biological activity. In silico techniques, including molecular docking and virtual screening, allow researchers to rapidly evaluate the binding affinity of a large number of compounds against viral proteins, thereby streamlining the identification of promising candidates.

**Project Overview:**
- **Week 1: Data Collection and Preparation**
  - Curate a database of natural compounds from public libraries (e.g., ZINC database, ChEMBL).
  - Obtain structural information for the SARS-CoV-2 targets, such as the spike protein and main protease (Mpro), from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
  - Prepare the compound library by cleaning structures and generating 3D conformations for docking.

- **Week 2: Virtual Screening**
  - Perform molecular docking studies using software such as AutoDock Vina or Glide to predict the binding affinity of natural compounds to the selected viral proteins.
  - Analyze docking results to filter for compounds with high binding affinity and favorable docking poses.

- **Week 3: Analysis and Reporting**
  - Further analyze top candidates using ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) predictions to evaluate their drug-like properties.
  - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing findings, including potential compounds, binding interactions, and future directions for experimental validation.

**Expectations:**
- Deliver a list of ranked natural compounds with their respective binding affinities and molecular docking scores.
- Conduct a preliminary analysis of drug-like properties for the top candidates.
- Present initial findings in a concise report and participate in a team meeting to discuss potential next steps.

**Additional Sections:**
- **Skills Development:**
  - Enhance skills in molecular modeling, computational docking, and data analysis.
  - Gain familiarity with bioinformatics tools and databases relevant to drug discovery.

- **Deliverables:**
  - Compiled database of top-ranked compounds.
  - Detailed report of methodology, results, and findings.
  - Presentation slides summarizing the project work and results.

Through this internship project, the intern will gain hands-on experience in in silico drug discovery, contributing valuable insights to the ongoing efforts in developing therapeutic agents for COVID-19.

### Title: **Exploring Novel Inhibitors for Targeted Cancer Therapy: An In-Silico Approach**

---

### Background:
Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. The emergence of targeted therapies has revolutionized treatment, but resistance and the complexity of cancer biology demand continuous drug discovery efforts. In-silico drug discovery, leveraging computational tools and data, allows for the efficient identification of potential drug candidates by modeling interactions at the molecular level.

### Project Objectives:
1. **Identify potential targets** for novel anti-cancer agents based on existing literature and molecular databases.
2. **Perform molecular docking simulations** to assess the binding affinity and selectivity of small molecule libraries against chosen targets.
3. **Analyze the results** to predict the most promising drug candidates for further experimental validation.

### Impact:
This project will enhance the understanding of targeted cancer therapies and contribute to the early-stage drug discovery process. By utilizing computational biology tools, the intern will learn how to streamline the drug discovery pipeline, potentially accelerating the development of novel therapeutics with fewer resources.

### Methodology:
1. **Literature Review**: Gather information on current cancer therapies and identify viable molecular targets.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Use public databases (e.g., ChEMBL, PubChem) to obtain small molecule libraries and their associated biological activities.
3. **Molecular Docking**: Utilize a software tool such as AutoDock Vina or Schr√∂dinger Suite to perform docking simulations of the selected compounds against the identified targets.
4. **Analysis and Visualization**: Evaluate the docking results using scoring functions and visualization tools like PyMOL or Chimera to identify strong binders.
5. **Report Generation**: Compile findings into a detailed report, including recommendations for the most promising compounds for experimental trials.

### Expectations:
- **Week 1**: Comprehensive literature review and molecular target identification. Compile a list of suitable small molecules.
- **Week 2**: Conduct molecular docking simulations, analyze binding affinities, and rank potential candidates.
- **Week 3**: Develop a report summarizing findings, insights, and potential next steps for further validation. Present findings to the bioinformatics team.

### Important Sections:
- **Deliverables**: 
  - A curated list of high-potential drug candidates.
  - Molecular docking results with detailed analysis.
  - A final presentation summarizing methodologies, findings, and recommendations.
  
- **Resources Required**:

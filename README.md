# CABS-Data-Science-Summer-Internship-Program

The Chinese American Biopharmaceutical Society (CABS) is thrilled to announce a new [CABS Data Science Summer Internship Program](https://www.cabsweb.org/events/5702230/CABS%202024%20Intern%20Program%20in%20Data%20Science%20in%20drug%20discovery%20and%20development/) focused on the cutting-edge field of data science applied to drug discovery and development.

As our industry generates unprecedented amounts of data from genomics, proteomics, clinical trials and real-world evidence, there is a growing need for talented data scientists who can derive insights to drive innovation. CABS is committed to helping bridge this talent gap and train the next generation of data leaders in biopharma.

This 10-week non-paid in-person/remote internship program will provide an immersive experience for undergraduate and graduate students to work alongside data science teams at top CABS member companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. Interns will get hands-on experience applying the latest machine learning, AI and data analytics tools to solve real-world challenges across all phases of the drug development lifecycle.

Not only will interns gain technical data skills, but they will also learn about the biopharma business through workshops, networking events, and mentorship opportunities with CABS member company leaders, entrepreneurs and investors.

A primary focus will be nurturing a talented and diverse pipeline of data science professionals, including those from Asian American and Pacific Islander backgrounds. In addition to students from top universities across the country, such as the University of Chicago, MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University, Duke University, University of Texas at Austin, Johns Hopkins University, University of Washington, Cornell University etc.

Notes:

1. The CABS data science summer internship is fully remote, with no on-site requirements.
   
2. The CABS data science summer internship is an unpaid position, offering full flexibility for the program.

3. Please do not apply for this position if you already have another full-time internship.

4. Our motivation is to enhance students' skillsets and provide pre-job exposure, including interview preparation and project experience in the pharmaceutical industry.

5. This is a part-time summer internship, not a full-time commitment. You are welcome to participate in multiple internships if you wish. However, please note that obtaining a recommendation letter for this internship will require a high level of engagement with the project.
6. The intern project encourages the intern to define the project, with the CABS mentor team providing support to ensure the program deeply and exclusively benefits the intern. We encourage the intern to take on a leadership role by identifying key questions, proposing the project, and thinking critically about potential solutions.
7. **Compliance with DOL Guidelines:** The CABS internship program will strictly adhere to the U.S. Department of Labor's six-factor test for unpaid internships, ensuring that the internship is educational and beneficial to the Intern without providing immediate advantage to CABS. This compliance guarantees that the internship is a legitimate learning experience and not considered employment.
8. **CPT and OPT Considerations**: While unpaid internships at non-profits generally do not require Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT), it is advisable to consult with the Designated School Official (DSO) at the student's university to ensure compliance with all F-1 visa regulations from your university, department, and local regulations.
